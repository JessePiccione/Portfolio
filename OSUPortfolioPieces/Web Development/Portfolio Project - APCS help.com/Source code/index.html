                    <p><div></div>I do not keep it a secret that I got a 5 on the Apcs Test. But, I credit all of that
                    to my teacher in High School. He was the one who pushed me to get there. If it 
                    was not for his belief in me, I would have never became a programmer. My story
                    with programming begins my senior year. I started out in the basic programming
                    class, and at first I had no idea what I was doing. My friend, Andy, had told
                    me to take the class telling me I would enjoy the teacher.He was right. The guy
                    was the best teacher I had ever had. That man was much more than a teacher to us.
                    My biggest regret was not taking this his class sooner.</p><br />
                    
                    <p><div></div>When we started programming, I could not get anything. I did not understand data
                    types, if statements, loops, or arrays. I sucked, and I sucked bad. I finished 
                    my programs last. I would stare at the screen with that confused drowling look 
                    that some of your classmates may be doing now. For a while, I hated programming. 
                    I dreaded it. I felt like I would never have a chance at doing this. Then out of 
                    nowhere, I worked harder. I could not tell you what my drive was. Maybe it was 
                    when, this total D boasted to me about how he was leaving the class the first
                    week for the AP class. I hated that and made it a goal better my own 'Java Skills'.
                    I basically became this programming perfectionist that was a teachers pet. 
                    Now, I was the total D. By the end of the first month. I was one of the best 
                    in my class. It felt good to be good at something. This is about when my teacher
                    changed my life. After finishing my program, he pulled me over and told me how 
                    I was great at programming so far. He then suggested I move into the AP class.
                    It was a big decision to make. I remember it like it was yesterday.
                    No one ever said anything like that to me before. If it had been any other teacher, 
                    I do not think I would've.</p><br />
                    
                    <p><div> </div>After careful consideration and pulling some strings, I entered in the class. 
                    Fun enough my first day was a quiz. On stuff that I learned the day before. I got
                    a hundred and boasted to the total D. But, I was different by then, programming made
                    me happy. It felt like I was learning something useful. All my life, I never knew wanted
                    to do. I thought I had no talent, my teacher made me feel like I could be something. That
                    feeling lives in me today. I was lucky that everything clicked at somepoint and I got a 5 
                    on the AP test. I got a 5 on the AP practice test. Every assignment and lesson he ever gave
                    us was full of fun and excitement. He made coding, which can be very tedious and boring, fun.
                    I can not desrcibe the affect he had on me. I will never be able to thank him enough.</p><br />
                    
                    <p>    It is because of my teacher, that I am making this website. His message to my class was
                    to help others, and be a good person. Because you can make a difference. So, I am dedicating
                    this entire website to my teacher. If he is reading this which would be pretty cool. 
                    I will say this: Gat, Thank you for everything. You have helped me and so many more students.
                    We can not ever thank you enough. You are the only teacher I'll never forget.</p><br />
